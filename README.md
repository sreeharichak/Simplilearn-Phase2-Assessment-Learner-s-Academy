# Simplilearn-Phase2-Assessment-Learner-s-Academy

Project objective:   

As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy. Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts.      


Background of the problem statement:  

Learner’s Academy is a school that has an online management system. The system keeps track of its classes, subjects, students, and teachers. It has a back-office application with a single administrator login.     

The administrator can:  
● Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes 
● Set up a master list of all the teachers 
● Set up a master list of all the classes 
● Assign classes for subjects from the master list 
● Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
● Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)        

There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class, such as the list of students, subjects, and teachers       

The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible.
